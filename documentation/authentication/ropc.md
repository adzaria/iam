# Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) flow

The Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) flow is a way to exchange a user's credentials for an access token.

The ROPC flow is often discouraged due to its inherent security risks. However, it is still widely used and accepted, often in combination with MFA. Therefore, it will be included in our service.

Implementation: [LATER IMPLEMENTATION]
