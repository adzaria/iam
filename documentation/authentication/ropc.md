# Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) flow (legacy)

The Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) flow is a way to exchange a user's credentials for an access token.

/!\ The ROPC flow is considered deprecated by the OAuth 2.0 community due to its inherent security risks and is not recommended for new implementations. However, it is still widely used and accepted in combination with MFA. For this reason we do allow it here.
